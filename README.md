# Twitter-Sentiment
Sentiment analysis is a process of determining the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text, such as tweets on Twitter. Here's a step-by-step procedure for performing sentiment analysis on Twitter data:

Define Your Objective:

Clearly define the goal of your sentiment analysis. Are you interested in understanding public sentiment on a particular topic, brand, or event on Twitter?
Set Up Twitter Developer Account:

If you haven't already, create a Twitter Developer Account and set up an App to obtain the necessary API keys and tokens for accessing Twitter data programmatically.
Choose a Programming Language:

Select a programming language for sentiment analysis. Python is a popular choice due to its rich ecosystem of libraries for natural language processing (NLP).
Install Required Libraries:

Install NLP libraries such as NLTK, TextBlob, spaCy, or VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) for sentiment analysis. You may also need libraries for data collection (e.g., Tweepy) and data manipulation (e.g., pandas).
Authentication:

Use your Twitter API keys and tokens to authenticate your application and access Twitter data.
Data Collection:

Use the Twitter API to collect tweets relevant to your analysis. You can filter tweets by keywords, hashtags, user accounts, or other parameters.
Data Preprocessing:

Prepare the collected tweet data for sentiment analysis by cleaning and tokenizing the text. This may include removing special characters, stop words, and URLs.
Sentiment Analysis:

Apply sentiment analysis techniques to the preprocessed tweets using one of the libraries mentioned earlier. For example, if you're using TextBlob, you can use its Sentiment function to get sentiment scores for each tweet.
